# RL_TicTacToe

Learning to play TicTacToe using Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.

Algorithms Used:
- Value Iteration - cs18b020_task3.py
- Policy Iteration - cs18b020_task4.py
- Q Learning - cs18b020_task5.py
- SARSA - cs18b020_task6.py

The generated policy files have also been added.

To try out playing with the learned agent, run ```python final.py```
